# Product Management Tool

This is a Product Management Project that uses JAVA and Spring. The project can read data from multiple CSV files using multiple threads and store the data in a SQL Database. Any further modification in the CSVs reflects in the Database when then the system starts.

The project uses Tshirts as model and the user can find a 'Tshirt' that suits his/her requirement based on Size, Gender and Colour. Further the user can also sort the results By Rating or By Price.
